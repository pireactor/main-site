desc: "We help clients explore requirements and work out what they really
    need today and to plan for tomorrow tomorrow. Instead of reiterating
    every week, we architect space for modular features and functionality
    expansions. Wepractice discipline to keep all parties on track and avoid scope creep.
    Only after the core project is complete do we start a new cycle"
