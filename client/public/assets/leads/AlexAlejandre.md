An LA, Alex was a polyglot by his late teens and leveraged his talent to attend a German engineering school's cross-vertical program, rooted in highly ‘production-process hands-on’ industrial engineering, with co-ops in specialist application metallurgy steel mill manufacturing lines. \n\ \n\
Applying those principles to the bloated software engineering space across inception to delivery to maintenance together with an innate entrepreneurial mindset, he set to tinkering innovations in the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC).
